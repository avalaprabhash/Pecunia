            <h3>1 cent coin</h3>
            <b>From 1966 until 1984, the obverse of the Australian one-cent coin featured the elegant portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, designed by the renowned artist Arnold Machin. In 1985, this portrait was updated to a version by the acclaimed sculptor Raphael Maklouf, which remained in place until the coin's withdrawal from circulation in 1992.

                The reverse side of the coin is adorned with the intricate image of a feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus), a charming gliding possum unique to the Australian states bordering the Pacific Ocean. This exquisite design was crafted by Stuart Devlin, the talented artist behind the reverses of all the original Australian decimal coins.</b>
