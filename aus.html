            <h3>1 cent coin</h3>
            <b>From 1966 until 1984, the obverse of the Australian one-cent coin featured the elegant portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, designed by the renowned artist Arnold Machin. In 1985, this portrait was updated to a version by the acclaimed sculptor Raphael Maklouf, which remained in place until the coin's withdrawal from circulation in 1992.

                The reverse side of the coin is adorned with the intricate image of a feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus), a charming gliding possum unique to the Australian states bordering the Pacific Ocean. This exquisite design was crafted by Stuart Devlin, the talented artist behind the reverses of all the original Australian decimal coins.</b>

It is still counted as legal tender, but is subject to some restrictions, and two-cent coins are legal tender only up to the sum of 20 cents.

It has been the lowest-denomination coin in general circulation since the withdrawal of the one-cent and two-cent coins in 1992.

                Due to inflation, the purchasing power of the five-cent coin continues to drop, and as of 2018 represents 0.27% of the country's minimum hourly wage for workers age 21 or over.</b>

On introduction it was the fourth-lowest denomination coin.
